    "\n",
    "### Workshop Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each week (Weeks 2-11), you'll receive a notebook like this one covering that week's topic:\n",
    "\n",
    "Topics will cover:\n",
    "- Rocket physics and orbital mechanics\n",
    "- Mission data analysis\n",
    "- Spacecraft payload design\n",
    "- Remote sensing and Earth observation\n",
    "- Technology spin-offs and innovation\n",
    "- Future exploration planning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Before the workshop**: The notebook will be added to the main repository\n",
    "2. **At the start of workshop**: \n",
    "   - Open Google Colab\n",
    "   - Go to File → Open notebook → GitHub\n",
    "   - Select YOUR forked repository\n",
    "   - Open that week's notebook\n",
    "3. **During the workshop**:\n",
    "   - Work through the exercises\n",
    "   - Write code, run calculations, analyze data\n",
    "   - Ask questions when you're stuck!\n",
    "4. **Save your work**:\n",
    "   - File → Save a copy in GitHub\n",
    "   - Add a commit message (e.g., \"Completed Week 2 exercises\")\n",
    "   - Click OK\n",
    "5. **That's it!** No formal submission needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "- You choose **4 out of 8** workshop notebooks (Weeks 2-11) to be assessed\n",
    "- Only work saved **during the workshop session** will be marked\n",
    "- The lecturer will access your GitHub repository directly to review your work\n",
    "- Your mark is the average of your 4 chosen workshops\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for Success\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Save regularly** - Use \"File → Save a copy in GitHub\" every 15-20 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Don't delete cells** - Even if you make a mistake, keep your work visible\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Add comments** - Explain your thinking with `# comments`\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Run all cells in order** - Before saving, run all cells from top to bottom\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Ask questions** - That's what workshop time is for!\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't wait until the last minute to save** - Network issues happen!\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't work on the wrong repository** - Make sure you're in YOUR fork, not the main repo\n",
