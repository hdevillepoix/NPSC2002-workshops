## Setting Up Your GitHub Account

GitHub is a platform for storing and sharing code. You'll use it to:
- Keep your own copy of all workshop notebooks
- Save your work automatically
- Allow the lecturer to access your completed workshops for assessment

### Steps to set up GitHub:

1. **Create a GitHub account** (if you don't have one):
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
   - Click "Sign up"
   - Use any email address you prefer
   - Choose a professional username (e.g., firstname-lastname)

2. **Fork the NPSC2002 workshop repository**:
   - Your lecturer will provide the repository URL (something like: `github.com/lecturer-name/NPSC2002-workshops`)
   - Navigate to that URL while logged into GitHub
   - Click the **"Fork"** button in the top-right corner
   - This creates YOUR OWN copy of all workshop materials

3. **Record your details**:
   - Once you've forked the repository, copy the URL of YOUR fork
   - It will look like: `github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/NPSC2002-workshops`
   - **Write this URL down** - you'll need it!

6. Click **"OK"**

**From now on**, use **"File" → "Save a copy in GitHub"** whenever you want to save your work!


   
## Getting updates

A new workbook will be posted by the lecturer every week.

However your fork of the repository will not automatically update.

To get the latest workbook, head to `github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/NPSC2002-workshops`,
and synchronise your version by using the **"🔄 - Sync Fork"** button.
